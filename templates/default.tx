<p>
This is the branch of the <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a>
meeting in Houston, Texas. Perl Mongers is a loose association of
international Perl User Groups. We discuss and educate people on the Perl
programming language, as well as projects and modules written in Perl.
</p>

<p>
We normally meet on the second Thursday of each month.
The meeting officially starts at <time datetime="18:00">6pm</time> and runs until around <time datetime="20:00">8pm</time>.
Meetings are open to the public.
We don't have any dues, <em>official</em> membership, or anything like that.
If you are interested in Perl, you are welcome to come.
</p>

<p>
For most technical meetings, we meet online via Zoom video conference call.
Details on joining the call are provided with the <a href="announce_meeting.html">Meeting Announcement</a>.
</p>

<p>
We also have social meetings at some nearby restaurant or pub in some
months if there is no topic for a technical meeting.
</p>

<p>Check the <a href="meetings.html">meetings</a> link for details.</p>

<p>Our meeting attendance has always been highly variable. Recently,
 there have been 10-20 people at the meetings.</p>
